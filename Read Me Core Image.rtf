\b \cf0 CIAnnotationSample
\b0 	An application using CoreImage to annotate images. It contains 2 custom Image Units.\

\b CIBevelSample
\b0 	Uses a CGLayerRef to apply effects to line-art drawn through CoreGraphics.\

\b CICarbonSample
\b0 	Using CoreImage from a Carbon application.\

\b CIDemoImageUnit	
\b0 Demonstrates how to wrap two filters in an Image Unit which can be used by any Image Unit hosts, for example "Core Image Fun House".\

\b CIExposureSample
\b0 	The 'Hello World' of Core Image. Opens an image and applies an exposure adjust filter to it.\

\b CIFilterGeneratorTest
\b0 	Creating, saving and loading a CIFilterGenerator and using it as a filter, all in one sample.\

\b CIHazeFilterSample
\b0 	A custom filter embedded in an application.\

\b CIMicroPaint
\b0 	This very simple paint program shows how to use the CIImageAccumulator API.\

\b CIRAWFilterSample
\b0 	Shows how to load raw camera image files and display them with controls over exposure and white balance.\

\b CITransitionSelectorSample	
\b0 Illustrates how to use transition effects and play several of them at the same time.\

\b FunHouse
\b0 	The source code to the "Core Image Fun House" application in /Developer/Applications/Graphics Tools/. This is an Image Unit host that builds automatic UI for all filters and that allows applying stacked effects to images.\

\b IUUIDemoApplication
\b0 	This sample demonstrates the use of the Image\
		Unit UI for CIFilters including the CIFilterBroser.\

\cf0 You may incorporate sample code from these examples into your applications without restriction, although the sample code has been provided "as is" and the responsibility for its operation is completely yours. However, you should not redistribute the source as "Apple Sample Code" if you make changes to it. If you're going to re-distribute the source, we require that you make it clear in the source that, although the code derived from Apple Sample Code,  you've since made changes to it.\
